# How to Crack EX4 Files into MQ4 Files for MetaTrader 4
 
EX4 and MQ4 are two different file formats used in MetaTrader 4 for Expert Advisor / Custom Indicator / Scripts. MQ4 is the source code file which contains the algorithm in MQL4 language and it can be edited using Meta Editor to make changes to the algorithm. EX4 files are an executable file format which can only be executed on the MT4 platform, hence EX4 files are used for distributing without exposing the code.

It is important to have the MQ4 file in order to understand or update the algorithm. EX4 files with older builds can be decompiled easily with decompiler software. But the converted MQ4 file code might not be really user friendly to read. But it can be easily structured by reassigning variable names, making it easy to read and update.
 
But the codes compiled using the newer builds of MT4 platform or the codes with external import cannot be decompiled using such software. In such scenario where the decompilers don't work, the EX4 files can still be cracked. But it has to be done manually and it requires following a stringent process of cracking the code. Even with manual process, it might not be 100% successful.
 
In this article, we will show you how to crack EX4 files into MQ4 files using a free decompiler software and a manual decoding service.
 
## Free Decompiler Software
 
There are many free decompiler software available online that claim to convert EX4 files into MQ4 files. However, most of them are outdated or unreliable. Some of them may even contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer.
 
One of the free decompiler software that we recommend is **Ex4-Mq4 Decompiler** from AutomatedFx Shop[^1^]. This software can decompile EX4 files with older builds and generate readable MQ4 code. You can download it from their website for free and use it as many times as you want.

4. The software will generate a MQ4 file with the same name as the EX4 file in the same folder.
5. Open the MQ4 file with Meta Editor and check the code.

Note that this software may not work for all EX4 files, especially those compiled with newer builds or with external import. In that case, you need to use a manual decoding service.
 
## Manual Decoding Service
 
If you are unsuccessful with the free decompiler software, you can try a manual decoding service that can crack EX4 files into MQ4 files for a small fee. One of the manual decoding service that we recommend is **EX4 TO MQ4 â DECOMPILER 2023**[^2^].
