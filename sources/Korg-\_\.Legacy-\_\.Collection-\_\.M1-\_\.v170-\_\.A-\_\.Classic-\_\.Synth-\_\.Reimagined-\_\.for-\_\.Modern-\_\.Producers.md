You can also use the Korg Gadget app on your iOS device to access the M1 sounds and create music on the go.
 
The Legacy Collection M1 v1.7.0 is compatible with both Windows and Mac OS X platforms, and supports VST, AU, AAX, and standalone formats. It also comes with a keygen that allows you to generate a serial number and activate the plugin without any hassle.

The Legacy Collection M1 v1.7.0 is not only a faithful emulation of the original M1, but also a powerful synthesizer that can create new and unique sounds. You can layer up to eight parts in a combination mode, and use the effects section to add depth and character to your sounds. The plugin also offers a master effects section that lets you apply global effects such as reverb, delay, chorus, and EQ to the entire output.
 
Another feature that sets the Legacy Collection M1 v1.7.0 apart from other plugins is the Korg Legacy Cell, which allows you to combine two instances of the M1 plugin and use them as a single instrument. You can also mix and match the M1 with other plugins from the Legacy Collection series, such as the MS-20, Polysix, Mono/Poly, WAVESTATION, and MDE-X. This way, you can create complex and rich sounds that go beyond the capabilities of the original hardware.
 
The Legacy Collection M1 v1.7.0 is more than just a plugin; it is a tribute to one of the most influential synthesizers in history. Whether you want to recreate the classic sounds of the M1 or explore new sonic territories, this plugin will provide you with endless inspiration and enjoyment.
